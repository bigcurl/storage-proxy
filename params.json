{"name":"Storage-proxy","body":"storage-proxy\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis repository is git flow enabled (default settings).\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nThe goal of this app is to show the consistent hash algorithm in use while proxing data to different storage systems.\r\n\r\nInitialy I use folders to represent cloud storage systems. They abstract away a more complex cloud storage api, we have better network speed (drive speed) and we have unlimited number readily available.\r\n\r\n## Request Lifecycle\r\n\r\n### Client:\r\n\r\n* Clients sends (html post) data to api\r\n* Clients receives (html get) data from api\r\n\r\n### Server:\r\n\r\n#### receive\r\n\r\n- api checks file size (header). should be smaller than 5 GB.\r\n- api determines hash of filename and folders (eg. storage services) to store to\r\n- api receives data and stores it into folder\r\n- api should take hash of receiving data\r\n- api should store hash and name of receiving data\r\n- api returns hash in response\r\n\r\n#### send\r\n\r\n- api determines hash of filename and folders (eg. storage services) to receive from\r\n- api streams file back from one of the folders to client\r\n\r\n### Config:\r\n\r\n* api needs names and hashes of folders (eg. services)\r\n\r\n## Part of PhD-Thesis\r\n\r\nThis code is part of my PhD-Thesis: A longterm storage strategy for the cultural heritage of the Federal Republic of Germany\r\n\r\nIt is an explorative sciences project which hopefully helps me gain some new ideas on how to tacle the problem of storing digital culture for future generations.
